 Hi I'm Billy, an aspiring electrical engineer from the UK. 
 
 I'm currently learning C++ to create programs for small projects in my own time, which I plan to use for the basis of a portfolio.

 I'm still new to writing programs and am using an arduino starter kit to begin my jorney into programming.
